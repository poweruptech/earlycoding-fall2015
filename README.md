# earlycoding-fall2015

Beginner class for grades K-2

## Class pattern
1. What have we learned so far
2. New concept or algorithm, with a physical activity
3. OPTIONAL Robot Turtles play time (adjust timing of other activities when included)
4. Apply concept/algorithm in ScratchJr
5. Open coding time
6. Sharing time

## Key class messages
1. Coding is giving instructions to computers (ref http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zykx6sg)
2. An instruction is ONE step
3. An algorithm is a list of steps/instructions to complete a task (ref http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/z3whpv4)
  * Algorithms are all around us - cooking recipes, LEGO assembly instructions, maps/directions to get somewhere
  * We also have algorithms in our heads for lots of things we do - how to get dressed, how to make toast, how to start up a favorite video game
4. Computers are really dumb - they only do exactly what you tell them, no skipping or adding steps, no changing order
5. Computers are all around us - smartphones, cars, tablets, laptops, thermostats, microwaves, traffic lights and more! (ref http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zc4x6sg)

## Concepts and commands
1. Moving a character across the screen
2. Record a sound and make the sprite speak
3. Use green flag to start commands
4. Use tap event to start commands
5. Turning in circles using rotation
6. Respond to a bump by doing something
7. Send and receive messages
8. Repeat forever
9. Repeat a fixed number of times

## Algorithms and challenges
1. Flashing/blinking using show/hide
2. Wiggling by using rotate back and forth
3. Two sprites start at the same time using green flag
4.
